# test_testnet4_passive_reorg_observer.sh — long-running passive observer
# that records any natural testnet4 reorg the standalone watchtower
# detects.
#
# The watchtower's reorg detection logic was validated synthetically on
# regtest (test_regtest_same_height_reorg.sh — forces a same-height
# reorg via bitcoin-cli invalidateblock + remine).  This runner is the
# real-chain counterpart: just let the WT run on testnet4 indefinitely
# and log every reorg it observes naturally.
#
# Designed to run for hours-to-days.  Run via tmux or nohup; check
# `/tmp/passive_reorg_observer.log` periodically.
#
# Usage: bash tools/test_testnet4_passive_reorg_observer.sh [WT_DB]
# WT_DB defaults to any LSP-side persisted DB (auto-detects most recent).
